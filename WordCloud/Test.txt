Ocean breeze did nothing to comfort her.
	It once had -- her Nín’na had always told her that saltwater was in her blood as much as iron was, all the way back from when her tribe used to spend their time catching trout and using bison skin in their yurts. But now, there was nothing but a hollow emptiness, and she didn’t try to hide it from eyes of charcoal.
“Head up, my love,” came her father’s steady voice, behind her, a large hand moving against her back. Even furious with him as she was, she wore his bomber jacket, and it caught wind from the bow of the boat and hissed against her tied hair. “Six months isn’t so long.”
“It’s half a year, Nín’na,” she scoffed. “All my friends will’ve forgotten me by then.”
“Then they’re not your true friends.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Eyes roll, attention diverted away. Nín’na’s smile was sad.
“You know how much I love you, right?”
The hardness in her face was only edged off the slightest bit. Her voice was quiet. “Yeah, yeah.”

The aircraft carrier would only be out for six months, as Nín’na kept reminding her every time he saw the grimace on her face, but it still felt and sounded like an eternity to her. She couldn’t imagine staring at ocean waves for months. She couldn’t imagine feeling slick salt water grasping her hand rather than a baby brother’s fist, couldn’t imagine being lulled to sleep by waves rather than her mother’s voice.
She’d chosen this, she tried to remind herself. She’d chosen this.
… But. Still.
Regret was a bitch, she guessed.

And that regret stung more and more with each new piece of information.
She was sitting in quarters with her father, unpacking -- pulling out clothes, finding a baby toy Rylan must have dropped in, unnoticed by her, wondering if she could call her mom and let her know where it’d gone. He probably wouldn’t notice, spoiled brat that he was, she thought, with a smile small with affection. The air was tinged thick with cinnamon and spice that stung with a breath inwards, but if she held the mostly-cloth rattle close enough, she could feel the soothing scent of soft lilac and lavender.
She should’ve stayed with them. She was an idiot.
“Classes start early Monday morning,” Nín’na said off-handedly, hanging up some shirts of his own, smoothing out the front. Mostly civvies. “0700 hours.”
“Wait, what starts when?” So caught up in her memories, Peta almost didn’t hear him.
“... Classes? Starts--”
“Classes? There’s going to be school here? I thought I’d be the only kid my age.”
“Turns out there’s one other, and someone’s wife didn’t mind renting out a conference room to teach you guys.”
“School in a conference room with one other person?” She probably shouldn’t’ve said that out loud, but fuck, he heard it, too, right?
“I know.” Apparently. He grinned at her, and looked older than ever -- lines beneath his eyes, against the sides of his face. Tanned face seemed weathered, exhausted with age, with battles fought and hardly won recently. She could see in his eyes that he didn’t want this to be another one. “She’s your age, apparently. Some Hispanic girl.”
Peta sighed, stared at the rattle.
Absolute bullshit.
It wasn’t Nín’na’s fault, she reminded herself. Not his fault that he got assigned this posting, not his fault that Naáhsa left, not his fault that he was alone with nothing. Not his fault that life kept taking, kept leaving him withered, small, a shell of who he was always meant to be.
Not his fault. Not her fault. Maybe no one’s fault.
So Peta closed her eyes, sighed, and, for a rare once, didn’t argue.

It was hard to imagine what class would look like inside of this metal box. Under deck, everything seemed to be silver-colored, smelled like a strange mixture of iron and saltwater, so much so that she could almost taste it at all times. Lights were always tinted too orange or yellow, left her skin feeling the wrong color, made her eyes ache when she went above deck and saw the world in the hues they were meant to be seen in again. Nín’na told her there were storms, that they could rock the deck so violently it’d be hard to stay standing. How the hell was she supposed to study during shit like this?
Class was the first Monday, 0700 hours, as Nín’na had said, but could anyone blame her if she wanted to swallow in more sunshine and sea air before she went to the grave below deck? She stared at her fingers as if she wouldn’t be able to see them below deck.
Christ alive…

It wasn’t until 0722 that Peta arrived to the designated observation room. To be fair, only half of that had been avoidance -- the other half had been her solidly getting lost. The copper colored city beneath above deck was full of rooms, doors, hallways, twisting and winding, and she’d only just gotten here. Someone should draw a map, she thought. Not her, but someone else.
Hands tugged at a metal bar before her until she felt a click, and after a push and shove, the door swung inwardly open for her. It was always a laborious task, opening any of these doors, but she shoved her hands in her pocket, leaned casual to mask her panting. Her air of nonchalance, that had never had to be faked on land.
 The teacher was a round woman with long, dark hair. Peta thought she maybe looked a lot like she would, when she grew up, and that thought gave her a bit of a shiver. Imagining her still here, as an adult. She had wirey glasses, and a dimpled smile that Peta was sure she could match if she weren’t always so, y’know, pissed. She was wearing a nice dress shirt and pants, a black bowtie tied at the front.
Next to her, sitting upon a desk and beaming up at the teacher, had to be the other student her age. Tanned, yellow-y skin. A skirt with pink roses on it. A tank top. Those stupid Mary Jane shoes, complete with the white socks and the frill and all. Red hair that fell in curls beneath her chin. Peta couldn’t help but sigh automatically.
“Oh, welcome. Thanks for finally joining us.” The teacher thought she was funny, she guessed. “I’m Miss Locklear.”
Peta nodded, feeling a little undressed for a moment -- she could almost hear Naáhsa snipe at her in the back of her head. Attention turned to Miss Mary Jane.
She slid from the table as eyes settled on her, walked with a lightness to her feet, nearly bounced and floated her way over to Peta, before offering her hand, a flourish of smiles. “Valeria. It’s a pleasure.”
“Alright,” Peta said, taking it, shaking it limp in response to the firm grip she’d been offered. Then, at everyone’s attention, “Peta.”
It was time to officially start classes, it seemed. Peta and Valeria both took seats at the conference table as Miss Locklear began questioning them on their level of schooling prior to coming aboard. Valeria was sheepish but kind enough to definitely have a homeschooled vibe to her, and Peta sighed at the thought. Did this count as being homeschooled? She lived on the carrier, after all. Was she being technically homeschooled for these few months? Why couldn’t she just take a few months off? Take classes in the summer, or something? Arms crossed, head leaned on her jacket. It’s not even like she could sneak a nap in if she were exhausted, or miss a day. She was 50% of the class. Lessons halted if she did.
But it was fine, thus far -- of little consequence, it seemed. This Valeria chick and Miss Locklear had bonded in those 22 minutes, and she seemed more than enthused about taking whatever classes they were discussing. Peta stared at the polished wood table. At the least, this was one of the nicer rooms on the aircraft carrier. A conference room, after all. Maybe pilots would give testimonies here, meet with the captain. There was a window against the wall that opened up to a beautiful blue sky. The light in here was white.
It didn’t hurt as much.
At around 1415 hours, Miss Locklear decided to dismiss them. Valeria had given her a good idea of where to start, so it seemed like she’d be revising and going over some coursework for them for the coming months.
“What do you think, Peta?” Valeria was quick to ask. Miss Locklear hung around as she gathered her notes.
“About what?” If there were any positives, it was that Peta had successfully gone through an entire day of school without bringing or needing a pencil. That couldn’t keep up, of course, but hey. Not too shabby, right?
“Whether we should do a subject a day or split it like an actual school day.”
Her eyes were hazel, Peta noted -- or perhaps that was just because the light was glowing into it. Her face was dotted by small freckles. A little constellation, almost. Sand on the ocean floor. Peta felt faint amusement at that thought.
“I don’t know. Probably split it like an actual school day. There are some subjects I can’t imagine doing for hours straight with no rest.”
Valeria laughed -- Peta had no idea what was so funny. It was a high, sweet sound. So goddamn annoying.
“You’re right. Maybe we should split it.”
Miss Locklear said something in response, but Peta was already standing, stretching from her hours of slumping. “Think we’re going to get out every day at around this time?”
“Depends how much I have to teach,” she responded. “Maybe, though. Why? Is it too early?”
“I think it’s just perfect,” Peta said, flatly, but genuinely. She was sure no one needed the clarification.
“I like your jacket,” Valeria called. Peta froze, looked back at her.
“Uh. Thanks. It’s my dad’s.”
“Your dad has good style.”
“Good service, I guess.”
The door groaned open behind her, hissed shut as it closed. They were there alone, for the briefest of moments.
“How long has your dad been serving?”
Oh, boy. It was a lead-in to a conversation, not a throwaway compliment. They’d hardly said anything to each other and Peta already felt drained at the prospect.
 “Listen, Val.” Valeria’s eyes fluttered in surprise, but Peta kept going. “No offense, but I’m probably not going to like you very much. Don’t feel bad about it, okay?”
A beat.
Nothing. Valeria just stood there, blinking, as if waiting for more. Peta was considering saying it again, or rephrasing, or, God, something, but the soft, round face before her scrunched, and there was a squeal released as she burst into a shocking guffaw.
“Wow,” she gasped, between laughter. “Yeah. No. Yeah. I get it.”
Peta had a feeling that she really didn’t, but she just ironed her lips together, nodded hard, and hoped that that was the end of it. “Anyway,” she said, as if there were anything to continue to, now.
“Anyway,” Valeria responded, and indicated the door. There was a playful shimmer in her eyes that Peta definitely didn’t get, but she understood the unspoken nod enough.
“Yeah.” Peta pried it open, held it for her, murmured another “Yeah” in response to the “Thank you.”

Valeria didn’t attempt to start any further conversations with Peta, but she definitely didn’t seem uncomfortable with her either. There was an occasional greeting, a, “Hi,” a question during class about homework, but most of their interactions were fed through Miss Locklear.
That was, until Thursday.
“Oh, there you are.”
Peta could feel her face crumble into incredulousity as she turned to greet her. Still all skirts, all bright colors, well-put together and beautiful on a ship in the middle of the ocean. That bouncy, flowing walk.
“Excuse me?” Peta nearly spat.
“You look better up here.”
Peta’s head swam as eyebrows jumped down, charcoal eyes glistening in the light. Was that it? The color of the light? Did she mean she looked bad under yellow light? Everyone did, right?
“More like yourself. Almost at peace.”
“Oh.” Defense crumbled, slightly. “I guess.” She looked out over the ocean, lines of dark blue and green meeting a line of light blue. Sunlight turn cresting waves white. Everything seemed white and blue, out here.
“It’s beautiful up here, huh?” Valeria moved next to her, rested her arms on metal poles slippery with salt, that always seemed to be cool even beneath the brightest of suns.
“It is,” she agreed, quiet.
They stood there in silence for long enough for an uncomfortable feeling to balloon in her stomach, in her throat. Peta chanced glances at Valeria, but she seemed too carefree -- eyes closed, long eyelashes catching light as her face was turned skyward. Enjoying the sun rather than lighting beneath deck that always seemed warm in color but stale in temperature.
Valeria’s apparent relaxation with their closeness and silence helped Peta’s own. After moments, she even tugged at her jacket, fished a picture from it. It was Nín’na and Naáhsa in traditional dress, cradling a baby with her long face and broad nose. Her, of course.
A happy family.
God…
“Oh no.”
Peta jumped, shoved the paper in her pocket. “What?” Praying against prayers, of course, it’d have jack shit to do with her.
“It’s a seagull.”
Dark eyes follow where Valeria’s frowning attention is directed -- a few feet down, from where they were standing was the white bird, standing on the same railing they clung to. “Weird,” Peta said, dispassionately. “I thought we were far from shore.”
“We are.” True, real emotion appeared in hazel hues as she turned to Peta. She looked… desperate. “Isn’t it awful?”
Peta paused, didn’t say anything. Her confused, harsh gaze spoke it all.
It was fine, though, because Valeria kept going, passion alighting against the bends of her face as she spoke. “All the way out here, all alone. So far from shore. Poor thing probably can’t get back.”
“Probably,” Peta agreed. She felt nothing stirring in her heart at the thoughts.
“No, really.” Her hand fell against Peta’s jacket arm, and dark eyes watched as it hung there. “No family. No friends. No anything. Isn’t that sad?”
Her voice spoke of someone who’d never known something like that. Who’d never known no family, no friends, no anything.
But here they were, anyway. Out in the middle of nowhere, no spot of land in sight. Family torn apart by affairs and declaration of new love, by the birth of a baby boy who giggled all the time and hid his toys in her suitcase.
No anything.
“Yeah,” Peta breathed automatic. And then it was silent again -- two teenage girls standing on deck, staring at a seagull staring at the endless blue. Valeria’s hand on her arm.
“A fowl.”
Peta didn’t even realize she’d spoken until Valeria’s attention was back on her again, confusion mixing with the sadness just there. “What?”
“It’s not awful, it’s a fowl.”
A count of one, two, three -- and Valeria took her hand from Peta to cover her mouth. There was that laugh, again, too high, too light, so girlish. The kind of laugh Peta would’ve happily made fun of with her friends behind her back.
“That’s awful.”
“Hey, we all have our gifts,” Peta mumbled, looking down to hide a smirk of her own.
“And I guess delayed puns is yours?”
A shrug, an mmm before answering. “The longer the delay, the better.”
“Of course.” Her hands fell, her beam was wide. Something felt warm as Peta watched Valeria turn her back on the ocean to stare at her, crossing arms over her chest as though to keep herself warm. Her skirt fluttered in the sea breeze, and curls began obscuring her face and smile.
“You’re right, though,” Peta said, to distract herself from staring at the wind playing with Valeria’s form. “That… is sad, I guess. God, Val, I think you’re the only person in the world who can make anyone emotional about a random seagull.”
“Hey,” she said, with a shoulder itching to her ear in a shrug, leaning against the railing with a casualness that seemed so practiced. “We all have our gifts.”
Her nonchalance in delivery was perfect enough to shock Peta with a laugh of her own. Just a quick ha!, but more than she’d gotten in years.
“God, fuck off,” she mumbled, but Valeria stayed by her side for hours more, and she found she didn’t quite mind.

Life on the aircraft carrier maybe sucked a little bit less than Peta had originally thought it would. She got to wake up hours after Nín’na had to report, though he still attempted to shake her awake with him every day, much to her groaning. The walk to her classroom wasn’t that bad, and it was in the path of the food synth that made the best strawberry smoothies on the ship. Miss Locklear couldn’t care less if they ate during class, so long as they were paying attention. The natural light was nice to get for a few hours every day. Valeria was always more than happy to offer her a pencil if she asked, and Peta could spend 90% of class time making eraser drawings on the hardwood -- which fascinated Valeria, for some strange reason. Peta could even hide an earbud in her braid and shuffle some playlists during class. And hey, she was even second in her class. Not too shabby, though Nín’na laughed every time she brought that up.
Lunches were usually held in mess room 3, and sometimes Nín’na would come join her. Other times she’d synth a soup or burger or something and sit on deck and watch the sky. Her phone was done with ship reconfiguration weeks early, so she got to spend her time watching video messages from Naáhsa and Rylan, and on days they’d sent nothing, she’d watch movies on deck until some sailor came to chase her away because of a landing or a difficult recharge or something. None of Peta’s friends were concerned enough to send her a message, it seemed, and she knew she shouldn’t be surprised about that. High school was busy, after all, and no one was required to send her a message.
… God, still, though.
It had been a few weeks into school that she’d skipped her first day. Eyes stung and hands wrung. The picture of anxiety, she felt. A perfect portrait. Tumultuous sea, tumultuous her.
“Hey.”
She could hardly hear Valeria over the sea churning, the groaning deck. She felt exhausted at the single word.
“What?”
“Miss Locklear and I are looking for you. You weren’t in class. We thought something might be wrong.”
“How’d you know to look for me up here?”
Valeria didn’t answer. She didn’t have to. Peta was always above deck when she could be. To be fair, so was Valeria, but it was a big enough ship to not run into one another unless they wanted or had to. She didn’t reach out and touch her, but something about the emotional, kind, warm gaze made Peta feel as though the hand was already there.
“You’re crying,” she said, gentle -- her voice almost sounded sick with that emotion.
“I’m not.” Peta looked away. “It’s just my eyes glinting on the water.”
Valeria waited, as though she’d admit otherwise in a few moments.
“Really. I’m not crying. I haven’t cried since I was six.”
Silence. Peta found a breath deep enough to try to begin explaining her sadness.
“I lost something. It’s not important.”
“Is that why you skipped school?” Valeria prodded. Her tone seemed to say, If you skipped school over it, maybe it is important.
Peta pretended not to hear it. “Any excuse is a good enough one. I hate school.”
The wind hissed at them. A wave crested against the side of the carrier. It was so far down. Peta couldn’t imagine falling that far down. She felt like she wouldn’t even hit the water -- she’d just be falling in a void, forever and ever and ever.
“What was it?” Her Mary Janes squeaked as she stood on her tiptoes, pushed herself against the railing. It jolted Peta back to reality. “That you lost.”
“A stupid picture,” Peta snapped, hard. “Just a piece of paper.” It doesn’t matter.
“Piece of paper?”
Peta was about to say duh when she looked over and saw a hopeful gleam to Valeria’s eyes. Oh, God, what was it, now?
“If you left it somewhere by accident, or it fell out of your pocket, or something, one of the bots could’ve taken it.”
“A cleaning bot?”
“Yeah!” cried Valeria, but she could’ve easily said duh.
“You sure there’re cleaning bots here? There weren’t any at the city we docked out from.”
“My grandma’s a maintenance engineer,” she responded in a gleam, calm and relaxed. “I wouldn’t be here if they weren’t.”
The quiet that fell over them was heavy. Peta could almost hear you don’t really want me here, anyway, but Valeria’s smile belied none of that. It was… guilt that brought that forward, probably. It rose hot in Peta’s throat -- she swallowed it down.
“Can we go down and look?”
“Yeah. My grandma’s on duty. If she doesn’t know where it is, maybe she can send a few more bots out to look.” Valeria’s hand hit her shoulder, the bomber jacket. Peta couldn’t help but cringe.
“I’ll, uh, text Miss Locklear,” Peta offered. “Say class is off?”
“Good idea,” Valeria simpered.

“Good timing, mija. I need your-- oh. You brought a friend?”
Valeria’s grandmother had a strong jaw, a strong nose -- eyes set and dark. Something in her lip line seemed to say that she was ready to tackle Peta to the ground if she didn’t salute when she walked in. Her fingers fell into fists in her jacket.
“Yeah, Abuela. This is Peta.”
One of the jacket pockets moved up a bit, a lazy wave. Valeria’s grandmother accepted it.
“I was going to say eagle eyes,” she said, but her voice was hard. “One of the bots found a picture, and I’ve been looking through the manifest to see who it belongs to.”
“I don’t think you need my eyes. Just my friend.” Cheesy, Peta thought, as Valeria clapped a hand on her back. She shuddered again, a byproduct of a lifetime of never being touched. “She happened to lose a picture.”
Abuela’s eyes narrowed, looked Peta up and down as though memorizing her -- dark jeans, faded T-shirt, bomber jacket, braided hair, hair gaze, all -- before offering the faded sepia toned picture. It was it. It was hers. She was too busy staring at it to realize her lips had parted, she’d sighed gratefully, but when she looked up, Valeria was smiling with a soft reverence, and even her abuela had loosened just barely enough to raise your eyebrows. Valeria wrapped her arms around an abuela who didn’t offer it back, a kiss, before they pushed past the bulkhead door.
“It’s a picture of your family?” Valeria asked, peering over her shoulder. “Who is it? Your mother, your father, you?”
“Yeah.”
“I guess your family’s important to you, then?”
“I guess.” She turned it over in her hand as though she’d never done that before, stared at Naáhsa’s handwriting declaring their last name and the year it was taken. Things were simpler then, she guessed. Just the three of them, against the world. A shitty apartment overlooking a great lake. Naáhsa and her having fun, staying up late, sleeping in Nín’na’s bed, when he shipped out. Him taking her on fishing trips, teaching her of their ancestry, teaching her how to play a reed recorder. Her school friends and her skipping school, smoking weed at abandoned playgrounds and long nature trails that no one ever hiked up. Her cleaning everyone out in poker, always.
Was that why she missed it? Did she really yearn for simplicity, for things to be just the slightest touch easier for her? Did she want parents that weren’t happy with one another to be in their loveless marriage again? Did she want to be back at a school with friends who couldn’t bother to text her when her Nín’na and her shipped out? Did she want Rylan to have never been born?
No. Of course not. That was stupidly selfish, for a life that wasn’t anywhere near perfect to begin with.
So why did it still hurt? Why was the change she always begged for in every other situation so unsettling when applied to her own life?
“Family is important,” Valeria agreed, and her voice had a strangely nostalgic feeling to it. “I’m sorry if I pried, though.”
“Huh?” How long had that silence been ringing in her ears? A minute? Two? Shit. “Oh, no. It’s, uh, fine. I was just… thinking.”
All of Valeria’s face said, what about?, but she chose, “I understand,” instead.
The two of them walked the long walk to one of the portals -- Valeria was staring at something on her phone. A frown creased her face.
“What is it?”
“Miss Locklear wants to know where we are.”
“What are you going to tell her?”
They stepped into the portal, grasped onto the metal bars as Valeria closed the door behind them. Five seconds after the door clicked behind them, there was a hissing -- and then their pod was spit into sunlight.
They turned their handles, released them, and the pod door slid open to let them out.
“Well, I told her class is off. So, class is off.”
“You’re gonna skip class?” A smile broke out on Peta’s face. “You? Miss Goody Two Shoes?”
“Hey, what the heck, right? I’ve skipped class the last 15 years. Another day won’t hurt.”
Peta was sure she could see the shock and confusion on her face, but if Valeria could read it, she wouldn’t say anything in response to it -- she’d just beam.
“Well… I’ve never skipped class alone before.”
Eyes opened, smile half-fell, as if she were attempting to figure out Peta’s next words. But there was nothing, only silence.
“Technically, your whole class is skipping with you.”
A soft laugh -- she stared down. “Yeah, but I mean. Never… without someone.”
Valeria’s eyes were lit, like lights from distant stars over the deck at night. “Are you asking me out?”
Peta’s lips parted. Her throat felt dry with surprise.
Valeria received with a giggle, reaching out and linking their arms. “At least buy me breakfast first.”

Skipping class with Valeria wasn’t that bad, either, Peta came to learn. She showed her the strawberry smoothie synth -- which Valeria happened to be thrilled to try and ended up loving, though she admitted she was more of a mango-banana person, herself -- and the two of them sat in the shadow of the flag bridge as they drank their breakfasts. Valeria had had the good sense to tell them both to turn off their phones so Miss Locklear couldn’t hunt them down, and when she’d expressed fear about a red alert, Peta reminded her that it’d be put on the intercoms, as well. Red curls fell over themselves as Valeria sipped, and Peta noticed for the first time that she was wearing lipstick that matched them.
She shuddered -- Peta laughed. “You cold?”
“Freezing. We must be in the arctic somewhere. The water must be subzero.”
“Then it wouldn’t be water.” Peta was already shrugging off her jacket, holding it out as it shook in the wind like a flag. Valeria smiled her thanks as she pulled it over arms, shoulders. She looked so much smaller in the jacket, but Peta hadn’t ever noticed it was so huge. The pink in Val’s cheeks must be from the cold, Peta decided. Her next decision was to look away, over water that nearly seemed black beneath a gray sky.
“I won’t lose your picture,” Valeria promised. “Don’t want it to go where a cleaning bot can’t follow.”
“Cheesy,” Peta muttered under her breath. A few more awful comments like that and she’d be forced to yell it from the flight control deck so the entire carrier could hear.
“Maybe so,” came her response, shrugging as she voiced it, lips forming a small, faux frown all seeped in playfulness as she glanced away. “But at least I’m outwardly cheesy.”
“What does that mean?”
“I’m exactly what’s on the tin. I’ve never been good at hiding.” Her expression froze -- something in her eyes slipped at that thought -- but then she plowed ahead, without any reprieve. “You? You act all rough and tough but you skip class because you’re busy crying about a picture.”
The laugh that came from Peta was false, all born from anger and violence and blood. “Okay, first of all, I wasn’t crying.”
Valeria had a playful simper. “Mhm.”
“And secondly, I told you that any excuse would do. I just don’t like school, picture be damned.”
“Picture be damned,” Valeria repeated. Her voice was smoothed soft, suddenly. Teasing leeched.
It didn’t make good first date material, Peta considered, sipping at her drink. Whatever the hell that had meant.
“So, are you here with them? Your mother and father?”
“I’m here with Nín’na.” Confusion on Valeria’s face, and Peta jumped to fix it. “My father. It’s Blackfoot for my father.”
“Oh, neat!” She sounded as though she meant it. That wildfire of innocence and excitement seemed to be back.
“Yeah.”
“Where’s your… your mother?”
“They’re not… together anymore.”
“Oh.” The pain on Peta’s face must be obvious if that was Valeria’s tone. “I’m. I’m sorry to hear that.”
“It is what it is.” There was still a lump in her throat as she said it, though. And, God, she was so desperate to move away from all of that. That desperate. Desperate enough to ask. “You’re here with your abuela?”
“¡Sí, sí, ma chérie!”
Her cheerfulness and the horrible rhyming was bringing the cry of “Cheesy!” to a fever pitch already. Peta had to cradle her head in her arms to stifle it, but for some reason, it made Valeria find it all that more hilarious. Their howling attracted an officer -- not a lot of pips on his neck, but authority in his voice.
“Hey, the gallery’s supposed to be clear. There’s going to be a tour soon, you--... you two can’t be up here!”
“Of course.” Valeria consented with such politeness that Peta had never known, and she was jumping to her feet, helping Peta to hers without permission being exchanged. “Thank you.”
They were halfway to the portal when Peta whispered her confusion. “Thank you?”
“I -- I dunno, it just came out! It… it felt right?”
Peta didn’t laugh, but the joy bubbling orange in her stomach made her feel like she could’ve.

Valeria’s abuela’s quarters were fine enough, Peta supposed. The walls were somewhat bare. There wasn’t really anything here. The closet was empty of civvies from what she could see, and Valeria’s side were all skirts and dresses. It didn’t even seem like the poor girl owned a pair of pants. Peta couldn’t imagine.
There wasn’t even an entertainment set in here, just the small dining room table, an off-shoot bathroom, hammocks as bunks. The room smelled like nothing. Stale, dry. Empty.
“I don’t think Miss Locklear will come looking for us here, and Abuela doesn’t usually come back until 1800 hours. We should be fine here.”
Everything here was sepia toned, washed yellow, but somehow, Valeria’s smile was still bright as the sun when she turned to Peta. “So? What do normal kids do on their normal days of skipping school?”
“You skipped for 15 years, right? You’re the pro, you tell me.”
She simpered but said nothing.
At Peta’s instruction, Valeria turned her phone back on so they could watch bad movies and videos together. Peta was shocked to find that no movies or shows had been purchased or viewed on Valeria’s phone -- her smile was almost apologetic, claiming it was a new phone. Though wouldn’t her information have carried over from the old phone? Peta didn’t push it -- just shook her head and started detailing her favorite bad movies and shows for Valeria to choose.
The screen of Valeria’s phone was small enough that they had to hunch nearby to hear and see it well enough. It was awkward for the first few moments, then… not so much. By the time lunch had rolled around, Valeria was leaned against Peta with all the comfortableness that years of friendship would have afforded her.
The door before them began to groan.
Peta nearly dropped Valeria’s phone in her scramble to turn off the movie and stash it in her pocket. Valeria’s abuela seemed so tall -- one of her hands was folded behind her back, but it fell in front of her when she recognized the people in her house.
“Valeria.”
“A-- Abuela? You don’t get off until--”
“I had to get a piece from my chest for a repair.” Her eyes weren’t as hazle -- seemed darker than Peta’s, somehow, seemed dark as the depths of the ocean at night. Unfathomably angry. “You’re missing school with your… friend?”
“Oh, we have the day off.” Valeria’s smile somehow seemed suddenly forced. Her knees knocked together. She looked so small on the floor.
“Because you were looking for the picture.”
“Right.”
“What were you two doing?”
Valeria’s hand, mostly obscured by the jacket, went to her lip. Nails painted pink pressed against the dark stain. “Talking about school. Nothing interesting.”
“Hm.”
“It’s lunchtime anyway, Peta. I should walk you out.”
“Yeah,” was Peta’s weak, quiet reply -- she felt like she was watching a scene unfold she couldn’t begin to understand or comment on. It felt strangely… charged? Or intimate? Legs were steady, but her heart seemed to shiver as she stood.
They stepped out the door, left it open behind them. Their footsteps reverberated, Peta’s converse squeaking, Valeria’s Mary Janes clicking. Even tempo. Marching a matching beat in their hearts.
“Do you-- need to go back? To your abuela?” Peta asked, quietly, when they’d turned a bend and Peta felt as though she could breathe again.
Valeria gave her a smile somewhere between a grimace and a simper. “I don’t know?”
“I’m sorry if… if I got you in trouble.”
“I don’t think so?” She laughed, an awkward and sad sound -- a hand scratched at curls. “But it was worth it, to see Mark eat that centipede.”
“Oh God, I know, right? You couldn’t pay me.”
“I don’t know,” she considered, tilting her head. “An entire lifetime of whatever you want to do for like, ten minutes of something awful. Doesn’t sound so bad. Rather than a whole lifetime of something awful, you know?”
“Huh.” Peta’s shoulders felt very light as her hair brushed over them, glance given to Valeria. “I guess.”
They went to lunch together in relative silence -- one of them bridging awkward pauses with memories from the show until they were in mess hall 2, eating synth hot dogs and sitting on a bench against a wall.
“Well, school’s done,” Valeria murmured. “Lunchtime, and all. So I guess you can turn your phone back on.”
“Oh, right.” Going to grab it from a jean pocket, she fished Valeria’s instead. “Oh -- this is yours, too.”
“Wanna program your number in? So we don’t have to talk on the public chat room. You don’t gotta if you don’t want to, but it may help in arranging more… dates.”
The playfulness in Valeria’s voice evaporated Peta’s wish to call it out. Her own smile was small. “Yeah. Sure.”
The small address book was pressed, and as the names loaded, Peta felt a freeze in her soul. As though they really were in the arctic and she dove to the bottom of the ocean and breathed it all in. Her lungs, her blood, all of her. Frozen. So frozen the phone felt heavy, warm in her hands.
“Is something wrong?”
Valeria looked so innocent. Large hazel eyes amidst a round face, curls kissing her face and chin. A bit of ketchup on her bottom lip from the synth hot dog. She smelled sweet, like expensive French perfume. Like a jasmine.
“Nah,” Peta said, but she could hardly feel her lips in the chill.
There were only two people in her contact book -- Miss Locklear and her abuela. And contacts always synced between phones.
Peta was pretty sure she had thousands of people in her phone, and Valeria… had… no one.

Peta would think about the (2) she saw for months. Every time she breathed and smelled jasmine on her coat, she’d think about it. Every time she saw her, a flurry of skirts and sunlight caught hair, she’d think about it. Every time Valeria leaned against her, or grabbed at her hand, she’d think about it. Every assignment, every answer in class, every gleam when the teacher complimented her, everything she did.
2.
Their “date” sparked some sort of… something… between Peta and Valeria. Peta found herself reaching out to Valeria more -- someone who, contrary to Peta’s original belief, texted as stilted and bad as though she were just learning how to talk through text. Valeria basically lived in Peta’s jacket. They would get smoothies before class sometimes. They’d hang out after class in the mess hall, on deck. Valeria met and impressed Peta’s father on one of these many instances, of course. Valeria was a typical girl next door. No one would feel bad about bringing her home. God, they even did homework together, much to Peta’s chagrin. Valeria seemed like the picture of academic ambition. She didn’t only want to learn, she wanted to learn as well and the best as she could.
“You’re gonna have to ditch me if you want to be a good student,” Peta would warn, teasingly, behind a can of soda pop.
“If I didn’t have a class, I’d have no one to compete with,” she’d return, jutting her chin out and sticking her nose in the air in a picture of playful defiance.
It was a little before 1800 hours one dusky, overcast night when Peta and Valeria started packing up their school stuff so Peta could walk Valeria home. There’d been an unspoken compromise to try to get her home before Abuela, and though Peta didn’t exactly feel like they were sneaking around behind Abuela’s back, there was enough secrecy to give her a low, firey tinge of adrenaline in her stomach every time they cut it close. Valeria was complaining about some history they were learning about, how bullshit it was -- not using that word, of course -- and Peta was staring at her with all the gentle admiration one may afford to a child trying to grasp their first words when someone screamed at them.
“Maria!”
Peta’s eyebrows came down and Valeria’s nose scrunched up. Both of their names ended in the same sound as Maria, but neither of them were a Maria, definitely. Was some racist jackass yelling the first common Latin name he could think of to try to get Valeria’s attention? Peta’s fingers rolled into fists. Too bad her jacket wasn’t on her shoulders to hide it.
“A-- as I was saying,” Valeria continued, voice hushed, but the shout came again, along with footsteps pattering, reverberating, glowing. It happened in a blink -- a pale arm reached out and grabbed for the coat, spun Valeria around. She squeaked at the pressure.
He seemed to be a white man in his 50s, Peta guessed, and his blue eyes were hazed in desperation. He searched Valeria’s face and still seemingly saw no issue calling her by the name again. “Maria. My love. I’ve -- I’ve missed you. You look exactly like you did when you left.”
“I, uh…” came Valeria’s defensive stammer.
“Why are you looking at me like that? Don’t you recognize me? It’s Jackson. God, it was so long ago. I’ve missed you.”
Valeria was frozen to the place with shock -- Peta felt something similar. She opened her mouth, but her anger was so all-consuming, nothing was released. Nothing happened.
“I think you must’ve put a spell on me, dove.”
It was the final straw for both of them. Valeria had paled to a ghost, and Peta had reddenned as a metal pulled from a fire. He wore a pilot’s furred coat and cradled a helmet in a hand that wasn’t caressing her, but Peta still found no problem standing tall before him. Her hand came forward and slapped at the back of his. He released Valeria in surprise.
“Hey, back off, dipshit. Can’t you see this isn’t who you’re looking for?”
He looked at Peta as though he hadn’t even realized she’d been there. “What?”
“Her name’s not Maria, asshole. You’re scaring her. Whoever you’re looking for isn’t here.”
“You’re not… Maria? But you look--” A hand had been moving to a curl, and Peta slapped it so hard he yelped.
“I said back off. Unless you want a black eye to go with the ego that’s about to be bruised.”
“I-- I’m sorry.” He blinked as though he could not see, was trying to clear his vision and and refocus. “You don’t know her, do you? You look just like her. Maria--”
“Please, leave me alone.” Valeria’s first words were near-whispered to the floor, and now her face was red, as well. She said no more as she sunk into the jacket, turned her back, and scuttled away.
“Stay away from her,” Peta growled again -- had to break out in a sprint to catch up with her fast walking. It was near double her normal pace. “Hey, are you okay?”
Peta was never one for physical affection, had never been, but Valeria seemed to thrive on it, so her own hand came gentle, went to hold her back in affection.
She winced away before Peta could make contact. “I’m fine. I have to go home. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Peta slowed in momentary surprise -- it was long enough to Valeria to quicken her pace and seal herself in a portal. She only spared a single glance behind before, alone, she sunk to the level on which she lived.

“What’s wrong, otúni?”
It was all coming to a head, now. A grandmother that didn’t hug her or kiss her back. Three contacts in her phone. 15 years of skipping school. A strange man grasping at her arm.
Getting emotional over a seagull because it was alone.
Peta felt like she was looking at a ton of pieces of a puzzle with no idea what they were supposed to make up. How was she supposed to solve it? How did all of these unrelated themes come together? Isolation, loneliness… being recognized? Being frightened? What did everything mean?
“Peta?”
“Hold on.”
Her hands pressed against her forehead. She saw, in mind’s eye, a ray of light. A ray of happiness. A girl who sat on desks, on railings, and crossed her legs. A girl who was always cold and swayed with the wind. With only skirts and with bare quarters. Who smelled like night jasmine. Red curls and red lipstick. Pink nails. Who called them hanging out dates. Who texted like an adult who had just gotten her first phone. Who smiled at everyone.
What did it mean?
“Where’s your jacket, otúni?”
“Val has it,” Peta breathed, sat up as she did so. She felt nauseated, rocked by a sea in her mind, restless and unable to find the peace. Hands clutched at her stomach.
“Otúni, words can only be heard…”
“If you speak them,” she finished, soft, sitting up. “Alright. It’s about Val.”
“Girl problems,” he mumbled, voice low with understanding. “I think I’ve had my share of those.”
Peta smiled, small, but it was wiped away as Nín’na took a seat opposite of her, leaned forward with interest and care in his eyes. “It’s just… I don’t understand her. I don’t understand anything that happens around her. She’s just… a confusing mess.”
“We all are,” he agreed, soft. “Have you tried asking her about it?”
“Asking… her.” A melancholic scoff. “Now there’s a concept.”
“She doesn’t exactly seem like she’s closed off to the world.”
“No. She’s told me before she has difficulty hiding herself.”
“Then if you don’t understand, ask. I’m sure she wouldn’t have any problem telling you. You two seem to be… close.”
There was something like a jive in his voice, but so caught up with her own feelings, Peta could hardly hear it.
She slept solidly that night, but her dreams were tormented by visions of a girl with red curls that faded every time she tried to touch her. Peta woke many times through the night -- sometimes she felt so sick she couldn’t conceive falling back asleep again, before heaviness took her and drifted her back to her nightmares. She woke with Nín’na and received a kiss on the forehead and a wish of a good day before she drifted off yet again.
It was the buzzing of her phone that woke her fully. Hand shook as she grabbed at it -- Naáhsa never messaged so early -- and it was Miss Locklear’s name next to the message that brought ice in her veins and erased all thought of sleep from her mind and body.
Valeria can’t come in so school’s cancelled.
“What the fuck,” she whispered, beneath the sound of a thumping heart.
The coat of dark, stringy hair fell from its braid behind her did nothing to warm her. This was bad adrenaline -- there was no fun, no excitement, only terror, terror that made her take ten minutes to pull her feet into boots, throw water on her face, pull on jeans and a crop top. She didn’t even braid her hair -- let it whip with the wind, let it fall beneath her waist and sway with her shuddering. Let it fly behind her as she ran from her quarters, hardly taking time to lock the door behind her, as she rushed passed her favorite smoothie synth and straight to Valeria’s house.
She was way passed the point of text. Fuck that.
The portal couldn’t move fast enough, the world couldn’t fly passed her quick enough. Officers yelled and groaned as she raced down narrow hallways, almost bowling into them. She didn’t care. She didn’t care, she didn’t care, she didn’t care.
Until, that was, she was there. She checked her phone for the time -- prayed against prayers that Abuela was already at work.
“Val!” Fists against hard metal, hitting so hard that they stung, that she could feel the reverberations to her elbow. “Val, open up! Val!”
Nothing. Nothing.
“Val!”
Knocking with her left arm, now, because her right hurt too much to keep up the desperate pace in her soul -- black eyes narrowed when response was denied.
“I’ll kick down this fucking door if you don’t open it up!”
It wasn’t an empty threat, even if they were bolted and sealed to be airtight -- but still, she began hearing mechanisms click open, and she stepped backwards despite knowing the door would swing inwards.
Valeria look washed out -- no hint of makeup, eyes rimmed red, rounded body so small. She wore a night robe and hardly made eye contact.
“Good morning, Peta.”
“What the fuck? Miss Locklear texted me and said that school’s cancelled today.”
“She said that?” Valeria questioned, soft. Her gaze only raised slightly.
“Yes. What the fuck’s going on? Is this about the guy who grabbed you last night?”
“Kind of. Not really. No. I’m not allowed to be talking to you.”
“What? Since when?”
Valeria stepped back, and Peta put an arm on the door to push it more open, but -- no. Instead, fabric was pushed through the small opening.
“Please, take this back. I have to go.”
It was an automatic reaction to take the coat back, but letting her go? “Fat fucking chance. Let me in, Val.”
“I can’t. I’m sorry.”
“Let me in, Valeria.”
Her voice was near choked as it surfaced. “I’m sorry, Peta.”
The door slammed shut and the lock echoed louder than anything in Peta’s life ever had. She stood there and beat on the frame yelling until her hand started to bleed and the officer on patrol chased her away.

“Do you know why I needed to talk to you alone today?”
Peta had been on fire since Valeria closed the door on her three days ago. It didn’t feel like a rejection, but it didn’t feel like anything else she had a word for, either. Her throat was small, closed in on itself. Fingers fidgeted together. Each deep breath inward brought perfume and stale air, still hung on her jacket. They were in the observation room reserved for classes -- she kept staring at a desk and seeing a ghost.
Everything burned -- acid behind her teeth, acetone in her nails. The anger churning in her stomach was so intense that she felt sick and alive with it.
She wanted to beat the shit out of someone, and she wasn’t sure she could hold herself back next time there was someone who danced on that line.
“Is it about Val?”
“It’s about Val,” she agreed, a quiet nod. She seemed sad, colored gray, monochrome, flat in light of Peta’s churning vinegar.
“What the fuck is going on, Miss Locklear.” It was a question, but it didn’t come out like one. It was just a bite. A single question wrapped with tons. Why haven’t we been in school. Why haven’t I seen her. What’s wrong.
“Valeria’s grandmother had a talk with me yesterday. She has some… concerns… about the education she’s receiving here.”
“Alright,” came her response, distant and clipped. She couldn’t see what that had to do with her.
“Frankly… she doesn’t think you’re the best company for her to be learning in. She’s suggested that you guys… be separated for the duration of the trip.”
Peta was sure she was glaring at Miss Locklear, and though she’d frightened stronger, older men with that dagger gaze, it had little to no effect on her teacher.
“We can’t. We have school together -- we.” Throat closing again. Hard to breathe. Fingers twitching as they grasped at nothing. “I’m not… I don’t bother her in class, what the fuck?”
Sympathy in dark eyes. “She thinks you’re a bad influence, Peta.”
“I’m not a bad influence.”
“Apparently you hit a pilot that docked here a few days ago?”
“Well--” Oh, God. Oh, God, if she knew about that, what else did she know about? How much did she--...? Peta could see white, taste it, gapped teeth open at the searching. “Yes, but, you don’t-- he grabbed Val. It was different.”
“And apparently you wouldn’t leave her alone when she asked you to?”
“W-- what? I’d nev--...” Oh, God, she couldn’t breathe, she couldn’t breathe. “When?”
“A few days ago.” She glanced at Peta’s bandaged hand, sitting on her leg, and Peta’s  fingers twitched.
“No, I-- yes. I… she wasn’t telling me anything, Miss Locklear. I thought she was in trouble? She didn’t look well, it wasn’t like her, I…”
But even she could hear how weak it was. How did she know what was like Valeria? How did she know that this wasn’t typical? They’d only known each other a few months. Fuck, fuck, what the fuck…
“Fuck,” she breathed, leaned forward.
“Apparently she found your old school records. It didn’t take a lot of digging to see you aren’t the best student and you don’t have the best track record.”
“But -- I.” She had no defense. She knew she was a piece of shit, but did that mean she deserved to lose her?
Lose her. Huh. Like she was hers to have, anyway.
“It’s more than enough to get you sent off the carrier, Peta. Back to live with your mother.”
“That isn’t fair.” Peta was bent over her legs, hands clutching at her knees. Teeth grit together, kept opening and closing as if desperate to find something to close on. “That’d take me away from Nín’na. That’s not fair, Miss Locklear. He didn’t-- he didn’t do anything wrong. He doesn’t deserve to-- be alone out here.”
That’s why she’d chosen him after all, right? Naáhsa had a boyfriend, had Rylan. What did Nín’na have?
“Then you know what you have to do,” Miss Locklear’s voice came, sad and shielded.
Stay away from Valeria?
“Yeah,” she whispered, and raised herself. “Yeah. I do.”
Yeah, right. Fat fucking chance.

‘Staying away from Valeria’ was a mission that was failed in about sixteen hours, give or take -- but to be fair, was never properly taken up. Peta stayed up nearly the whole night, stewing in her own anger and upset, not talking to Nín’na. What was she going to say? I tried to knock her door down and got threatened to be shipped out if I don’t shape up? It wasn’t going to happen. She wasn’t going to get caught.
She hadn’t for years before that, anyway.
She faked sleep when Nín’na’s alarm went off -- groaned incomprehensibly when he kissed her and wished her a good day. She waited one minute, two. No footsteps in the hallway, no breathing anywhere else.
Up like a shot, and she liked the way this burned -- actually, not unlike a shot itself. Excitement, but too much anxiety, too. Too much of the possibility of a no. Too much of the possibility to stand outside a metal door with bleeding fists and heart.
God, this girl.
Valeria was the only person who could make her emotional about anything, not just seagulls, huh?
Hair wasn’t braided like it hadn’t been the last few days -- she threw on clothing, strolled down to Valeria’s room. The guy on duty on her floor gave her a level gaze but she smiled coyly at him anyway.
He couldn’t do anything today. A new day.
A gentle knock -- she stepped away from the frame.
It took a few moments, but the door finally clicked and swung in. Peta didn’t move into her line of sight until she saw curls.
“Hi.”
Valeria had been crying again. It was so obvious. Her round face looked up at her like a piece of paper that had been crumbled, desperately trying to smooth itself back to perfection again. Hazel eyes brimmed with emotion at Peta’s soft voice.
“Peta,” she breathed.
“Come home with me.” Peta’s hands found hers, and this time, Valeria didn’t pull away. This time, she just looked down at the link, breathed in deeply, tightened her grasp against Peta’s.
It didn’t take long to notice the bandage. “Oh, God. Your hand. What happened?”
“Your door.”
Valeria winced. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s… not your fault, I guess. I guess some things have been happening that I don’t know about?” It was a prompt, and Valeria walked right into it. Her nod was seeped in apology. Her body bent in on itself.
Peta shrugged off her jacket, like an automatic reaction, draped it over Valeria’s shoulders. Her smile was small as she found her hands through it.
“Come home with me,” she encouraged again.
“I really can’t. I’ll get in trouble.”
“Not if she doesn’t find out about it.”
Valeria crossed her arms in front of her. “It’s… wrong.”
“To come hang out with someone your age? Why?”
Light gaze fixed far away. Her eyes looked like sand, flat stones for skipping. Beneath water, defeated. “I… I agree with Abuela. We shouldn’t be friends.”
“Well, I guess we don’t have to be friends. I mean. I already took you on a date, I guess, so.”
Her smile itched up, a bit. “You don’t know what you’re playing with, Peta.”
“What? You’re going to tell me I’m doing something wrong? Getting involved in something bigger than me?” Valeria nodded. “That just makes it more fun.”
“Fun?”
“C’mon.” Peta’s hand took one of hers, linked with the fingers. She could see red creeping over her nose, beneath her eyes that were already dotted with freckles. “Think about sneaking out of the house and hanging out with me. Watching more bad movies. Talking. Doesn’t that sound fun?”
Something in her stomach was clenching and unclenching, desperate. Fingers tightened so they wouldn’t shake. She waited, waited, waited. Valeria was staring at the ground. Her smile was small and contemplative. Lips stained from lipstick not fully washed off, eyes wrung red. Clothes crumbled from sleep, covered in Peta’s jacket.
“Val.” Something made her hand move, trace her cheekbone, crest beneath her curls, the back of her hair. “Val.”
Valeria looked up at her. Neither of them were breathing, Peta noticed, so she must feel it, too. Some dragging deep in the pits of her stomach, drawing them closer together, until their stomachs touched, until their noses were brushing, until their lips met. They leaned in together.
It was warm, like swallowing sunlight above deck. It felt clean, and fresh, and new, and unlike the kisses of her past, all smoke and drugs.
“Come home with me,” Peta said. But this time, even her stoic voice broke cleanly into begging.
Valeria tightened their grip and smiled again, and Peta felt peace.

Valeria came over almost every day to be with Peta. She learned how to braid Peta’s hair. They walked bad movies, synthed worse popcorn. Nín’na was more than happy to have her over, any time he chanced home before Valeria scuttled off herself. Valeria was selling a lie between Abuela and Miss Locklear -- telling Abuela she had classes without Peta, and telling Miss Locklear Abuela had barred her from classes. Peta bitched about how her Abuela could take school away from her, but Valeria never seemed excited to talk about her family.
Whatever… nothing that there was to talk about it.
Peta got used to feeling nothing on her shoulders and lipstick stains on her neck. She got used to running her fingers through short curls. She got used to the feel of their bodies pressed together, of their breathing falling in sync.
It was good to not be alone, but even better: it was good to not be alone with Valeria.
When Peta and Valeria got the news that the charter was being extended, neither of them even complained. It was more time to spend in each other’s arms, talking, discussing. The gallery deck was essentially off-limits, in fear that a surveillance bot would catch the two of them and Abuela would get Valeria in trouble.
“What will she do, if she finds out?” Peta asked her one day, absently running her hand through her hair. She loved the way it jumped back to her scalp when it was released. Peta was wearing Valeria’s shirt, and Valeria was wrapped in her blankets.
“I don’t actually… know.” Her smile was small, beneath smudged red.
“You seem you don’t know much about your abuela,” Peta commented, voice feeling distant from herself.
“That’s… not totally wrong. She’s only been taking care of me for a few years.”
“Who was it before that?”
Her sigh was small, but they were close enough to feel it. “My mamá. Papá died when I was much younger. I never… got to know him.”
Three contacts in her phone book. Peta’s throat closed. “I’m sorry.”
“Oh, it’s -- it’s alright. It’s not your fault.”
Valeria’s voice sounded distant, too.

It was month two of no school, of laying with one another, in Nín’na’s quarters, sharing a mango-banana smoothie, when it happened. The blaring of the alarm was so sudden that Peta jumped, knocked the plastic cup onto the ground.
Red alert.
There was a strange, faraway look on Valeria’s face -- a mixture between terrified and controlled. “Get in the closet, behind your father’s clothes.”
“There’s no door on--”
“Get in, Peta.”
They clambered in the small space together, Peta hitting lights off as they moved, clothes rocking and falling from hangers as they did, hands linked. Valeria’s eyes were closed, eyebrows drawn together, face serious. Maybe she was praying.
They stood there, clutched together, waiting. Waiting.
It felt like an eternity -- an eon -- before red alert was shut off. The moment it was, Peta was grappling for her phone, shaking hands searching through her contacts for a single name.
He didn’t answer. He wasn’t answering.
“He’s -- the -- the flag bridge. We have to go.”
“Peta,” Valeria whispered, voice ironed low with sadness.
“We have to go, Val!”
She didn’t dissent again.
They did, together -- hands linked, moving through an empty, silent hallway that had never felt so imposing. Portal moved fast -- gallery deck was empty.
Empty. Empty.
Ocean breeze did nothing to comfort her, now. Not the breeze, not the blue sky, not the sun, not the bounce of her girlfriend’s curls in the wind. Nothing comforted her, nothing was right.
The portal to the bridges would prove that.
Door slid open to the bottom most bridge, a room of dark gray and large windows filtering light in. No one was manning any consoles, because they were all red.
Red, red, red.
Smeared with red, pale and dark corpses, unmoving beneath no light. Rivers of blood, a shallow of blood, and bodies floated still on it. Peta collapsed to her knees immediately. Valeria didn’t react.
“Nín’na isn’t here, Peta. We have to go.”
He’d be on the next level. That was right, that was right. But…
“They’re… dead?”
Everything was red -- small red clots, lumps, dotted the ground. What was that? What was that supposed to be.
“Peta.”
Valeria’s hands closed around her arm, dragged her to her feet, dragged her up concrete stairs railed with metal. Next level. Next level.
It was worse here, if that were possible. Perhaps the noises of the bottom level had armed the top for war, because blood here was layered over windows, smeared on consoles. So many clots, what was this? God, what was this?
“N-- No, it-- it’s-- not, it’s--”
There was Nín’na. Another unmoving figure on the floor. Another empty corpse. Another body drained of blood.
Jeans were blood stained the second her knees hit the ground this time, but honestly, she hardly noticed falling to the floor. Peta didn’t even notice when she slumped, when her head touched blood, as well. Her father’s eyes were still open, and he stared at the ceiling with an emptiness he’d never had in life.
“Nín’na?”
“Peta, stay with me!” Valeria was by her side, caressing her head, pulling her up. Everything here was bleached with the taste of iron, the dripping of blood. Valeria muttered something that could’ve been a curse, then…
“I can’t promise anything, but I will try.”
Two fingers folded over one another, and they sought the air. As she moved her finger, red light followed, dancing out the shape she drew.
A star.
The star brought an oval around her hand, and a finger swiped across it like scrolling through a phone list. She tapped something, and her hand glowed red.
“What the fuck is happening,” Peta said -- but she didn’t. She opened her mouth and moved her lips to say it, but no noise or air came out.
Valeria pressed the glowing red against Nín’na -- he lit in turn, a flash as though electrocuted. Once, twice, three times -- but his body still would not awaken.
“They took his heart. I’m sorry.”
Peta wanted to ask what the fuck she meant, but still couldn’t speak.
A shout in Spanish -- Valeria faded from view as she stood, turned to face an accuser. Peta could hardly force herself to turn and look. It was Abuela.
“Using magic when they’re here? In front of her? Are you stupid?”
“I’m sorry, Abuela. I was trying to save her father.”
“You and your trying to save people attitude. Don’t you know it’ll get you killed? Don’t you know it got everyone here killed?”
Valeria opened her mouth, gaped. There was finally emotion there. Perhaps there always was. Perhaps Peta just couldn’t read it.
“We have to go. I got one of their flyers charged. We can buy new clothes. Let’s go.”
“Is there room for three?” Valeria was already bending down to the shocked slump that was Peta. Hands bloodied from her father and his comrades grasped at the girl she loved.
“You really are stupid, Valeria.”
“We can’t just leave her here. We don’t know how many people are alive. It could just be us.”
“You can’t take her with us.”
“It’s my choice.”
“It’s her choice. She doesn’t know. She doesn’t know anything.”
“We don’t have time to argue, Abuela!” It was the hardest Peta had ever heard Valeria’s voice go, the most desperate, the most angry. “We’re taking her and that’s final!”
The void in Abuela’s eyes opened as if to swallow all three of them up -- but she had to relent, even with anger in her fists, it appeared, to her only surviving family member.

Peta was out for what felt like days, on that little airplane, flying above the ocean with Valeria and her grandmother. It was so hauntingly silent every time she woke, except for a gently ticking engine, that she could almost fade back to sleep and pretend that everything was fine again. That she would wake up back in quarters, with Nín’na planting kisses against her hairline before 0400 hours every morning. That her father, and one of her best friends, hadn’t perished horribly despite her girlfriend’s attempts to save him.
They landed one time, when Abuela was stopping to refuel. The moment she was out of the cockpit, Valeria was climbing over her little seat to wrap Peta in her arms. The sobbing started immediately, a breathless, desperate void opening in her chest, and she sucked in air in attempts to fill it.
“What the -- fuck happened -- Valeria?”
“The carrier was attacked. People looking for me.” Face was smoothed more melancholy than she’d ever seen it. Her own cheeks were immediately met with tears, and her throat sounded as though a fist was being pressed against it when she spoke. “Peta, I’m so sorry.”
“I don’t -- understand. Why?”
“I’m… from a line of… very powerful witches.”
Peta shook her head, as if in a refusal.
“I… I know,” she whispered. Her breath smelled like honey against Peta’s face. “Most people -- we’ve been hiding ourselves. Us magic-prone. But my family is very… hunted, for our powers. That’s how my papá died. An attack on our house. And that’s how my mamá died a few years ago, too. She told me to find my abuela if something happened, and I did.”
“You’re a… you do magic?” Peta whispered. “You didn’t tell me.”
“I’m being hunted, I’m… I’m not allowed to tell anyone.”
“Did you ever -- use it, for--...?” For what? Peta wasn’t sure what she was going to ask.
“No, no. Never. Only when I was trying to save…” She trailed off. She didn’t need to say it. Peta sobbed harder, more desperate. Snot, and tears, and hands reaching up to grasp at Valeria’s hair.
“Why?” No, she already knew that. “How? How did they find you?”
“Jackson.” Her eyes were sad. “He thought I was my mamá. Maria was… was her name. He knew about her magic. The dove.”
It still made no sense, made no sense. It still fucking ached behind her teeth, in her hands. She screamed out the pain she felt in her soul -- Valeria bent around her and sniffled into her hair.
“You, too,” Peta whispered, finally. “You scream, too.”
“Why?”
“Your whole family died because of this? And you had to leave the carrier? And you don’t-- h-have any friends, because you’re… because you can’t… because…?” It wasn’t fair, Peta decided. Not to her. Not to Valeria. Not to any of them.
So she did. Valeria’s nails curled into Peta’s back and she screamed, as well.
They screamed and cried for what felt like hours. Everything hurt for too long, but somehow, the gentle shapes Valeria was rubbing into Peta’s back made it all feel better.
“I’m not asking you to come with me,” Valeria whispered.
“I would. I w-- will. I--”
“You’d have to run forever. It wouldn’t be fair to you.”
“It’s not fair to you, either.”
“I don’t want you to be alone. Or -- if we break up, it’s not like you can back out, or anything.”
“I’m not backing out, Valeria. I…” She breathed in jasmine and honey and tears and blood and whispered, “love you.”
“I love you too,” Valeria whispered, but her breath shuddered like a restless wind.
Their lips crashed together, and didn’t pull away until their wounds stopped bleeding.

Peta woke as if from a dream, beneath a high ceiling, faded pink, popcorn decorated. Her phone was desperately consulted for the time, but when she went to check her texts, she sunk through the floor.
Not in her contacts. Not in her messages. Not a single picture or anything anywhere.
Valeria was erased from her phone as though she’d been bleached from her life.
“Val?” Peta pulled herself from a bed much larger than the one she’d been sleeping on for the past nine months -- stumbled through a house that could hold several aircrafts. Her hands were free of blood, and on a chest by the door of the room was her jacket, folded carefully.
“Val?”
Panic surfaced, exploded like popping bubble when she heard little pattering footsteps and felt little arms reach out and hug her leg.
“Rylan,” she whispered, and her voice tremored in pain.
She was back home.

Peta wasn’t sure what was most painful about all of this. Planning Nín’na’s funeral, watching her mother suffer the loss of the man she’d been wed to for over twenty years as she also lamented her most recent relationship falling through, or feeling a stinging loss of Valeria.
Valeria was nowhere in her life. From being there, a constant, being every second -- from months of her life being characterized by salty sea air lipstick kisses to absolutely nothing, not even a picture in her phone or a name in her contact book stung with a weight she wasn’t aware was possible. She was alone, she felt. Alone in every way possible.
Nín’na’s funeral came and went -- and none of her friends did. (She remembered Valeria holding her, and sobbing with her. She remembered Valeria drawing stars and attempting desperate to keep a man she hardly knew alive for the person she loved. She saw no one from school there.)
Peta’s birthday came and went -- a legal adult, drifting, floating into nothing. (Would Valeria have thrown her a party? She could imagine her squealing, putting streamers in their hair. She could imagine gifts and laughing and dancing.)
Peta didn’t go back to school -- no one noticed. (She remembered Valeria’s excitement for school, her tears when she was kept from it. The wound on Peta’s hand healed, and didn’t even have the dignity to leave a scar to remember it by. Just like Valeria. Gone without a mark.)
Valeria was everywhere. Every meal. Every girl who wore Mary Janes that passed her. Every shade of pink or red. Every sunny day.
Everywhere.
And nowhere at all.
The sadness was relentless -- and, as it turned out, not just directed at her. Peta found herself raising Rylan alone. Naáhsa had sealed herself from the world in her room, cried desperately over lost loves, over death, over a daughter who had no joy in her life. Bitterness consumed her, and when Peta’s phone rang when she was at the park with Rylan to tell her that her mother’s body was found against the tracks of a train, she felt cold but unsurprised.
A legal guardian, now, of a child hardly two years old.
She said she’d loved her.
So where the fuck was she now?

Pain was something to struggle and argue with. Peta wrote angry letters and burned them. She vented in anonymous chat rooms and changed names and places. She screamed and argued against circumstances that couldn’t be changed.
She remembered how miserable she was when she was first sent off on the carrier.
How it paled to now!
I’m not backing out. She stared out a window slick with rain.
I love you, too. Was she losing it? Had she imagined all of that? Those nine months?
How else could the sun fade, fall from orbit, and the world keep turning?

But it had to, after all, didn’t it?
Peta received the call at 0852-- uh, 8:52 am, on the way to… a job at a local ice cream store. Yeah, a job. Hey, this is what adults had to do, right? If she wanted to support Rylan, she had to get a fucking job at some point, didn’t she? She couldn’t just keep living off of her parents’ life insurance -- even if most of her paycheck was going to Rylan’s babysitter, anyway.
Speaking of, that’s who the call was from. Marissa, or Andrea. One of the two names. Peta couldn’t remember which one she’d hired, to be frank. It was hard to remember anything other than exhaustion and pain.
“I’m sorry to call you when you’re at work.”
Work started at 9, but. “It’s fine. Did something happen with Ry?”
“No, no. He’s good. There’s, uh… a girl here to see you. She says she won’t be in town for long, and just wanted to pop by.”
Exhaustion was shrugged off like her coat used to be. She sat up, straight, ramrod, eyes so wide her face almost ached. “A girl?”
“Yeah. Red curls?”
“I’ll be right there. Don’t let her leave.”
Peta had run many times in her life, but she didn’t think she’d ever run as fast or as hard as she had, right now. Feet beating, echoing, shoes squeaking and skidding. She didn’t even call out of work -- fuck them! Fuck everything, and everyone!
“Please be Val,” she prayed, clicking the pedestrian light button fifteen times in a row and then bolting out into the street the second she saw no cars anyway.
“Please be Val,” she begged, sliding into a puddle and skinning knees through her jeans -- she waved off helping hands to jump to her toes, continue running.
“Please be Val,” up every step to her door, fumbling with keys, before deciding to bang into the door with one of her bloodied knees anyway.
Marissa/Andrea looked surprised and unnerved when she opened the door -- Peta threw her keys against a cabinet and brushed passed her, praying to the beat of the heart in her throat.
Please don’t be someone else. Please be Val.
She was exactly how Peta had been imagining her -- exactly as she had always been. Faded floral dress, tank top. Curls had grown to shoulder-length. She sat on the floor, Mary Janes bent beneath her, playing with Rylan and his dolls.
She looked up, and her eyes sparkled. “He’s cuter than he was in the videos Naáhsa used to send.”
Nothing else mattered in that moment -- not the funerals, not the stupid goddamn job, not the babysitter staring agawk at them and probably texting the conversation in shock to her friends. Peta collapsed to her knees before Valeria, whipped and desperate as always, and cradled her face in her hands before her kiss came, violent.
They only pulled away when they both were breathless -- Valeria smiled small. “I was all prepared to not be mad if you didn’t like me, and all.”
“Shut up,” Peta growled. “You asshole. I said I’m not backing out.”
“I didn’t come to bring you with me,” she whispered.
“Just try and leave without me.”
She laughed, her high, gentle noise, and cradled her close as they kissed again.
“What about the baby?” Valeria whispered when they pulled away again, noses touching, rubbing, gentle.
“He’s coming.”
“You want to bring a baby into this life?”
“You’re basically a baby. You need me to protect you.”
“Oh -- ha, yeah, right!” Valeria’s eyes lit up in humor, and Peta bit at her lip to silence her. She squealed with the pressure.
They breathed in each other’s air for a moment before Peta spoke again, voice veiled serious.
“You have to promise -- if I come with you this time, you’re not leaving us behind somewhere.”
“I won’t leave you behind somewhere,” Valeria breathed, nearly seeped of air.
“Rylan and I -- we’ll be yours. We’ll be a family, the three of us.”
“What about -- Naáhsa?”
“What about Abuela?”
Same answer to both. They could read it in each other’s eyes.
“Nizitápimix,” Peta said to the space between them.
“Familia,” she vowed in return.

The babysitter was fired unceremoniously -- bags were packed, kisses were exchanged, history was bridged. Moments after slipping Peta’s jacket back on, baby Rylan, Peta, and Valeria disappeared into the blackness of night in search of crafting a new life.
